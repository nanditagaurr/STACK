The most famous program asked from a computer science student in our college is to check whether the given expression is valid or not in a given set of expressions. Same question was asked from us in data structure practical.:no_mouth: 
Due to lack of time I wished to search that program online and copy that.:disappointed: But sadly I wasn't able to find any such program online. :sweat_smile:
So I decided to write it on my own. :grin:
Gladly I was able to successfully write that program of Balancing Brackets.:bowtie:
So I have decided to help other students too by sharing that code, so that when in hurry they can copy that code. :innocent:
But as a responible programmer i would still suggest you all to create your own codes:grimacing: and be a good developer...:wink:
 
 It is a very simple and easy to understand code written in C.
